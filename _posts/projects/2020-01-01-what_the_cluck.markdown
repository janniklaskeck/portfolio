What the Cluck is a 4vs4 Splitscreen cross-platform multiplayer game.
Four players playing on a PC would compete against another four players on a PlayStation 4.

The goal of the game is to capture the enemy's team farm by carrying or throwing chicken into it.
These chicken spawn at their own farm and must be transported through the level while trying to avoid the other team.
In the middle of the level are several barns which can also be captured and provide another spawn point for chicken and with that a shorter distance to the enemy's farm.

Players can carry or throw chicken and tackle their enemy to get them to drop any chicken they currently carry.
Thrown chicken can be caught by any player, allowing to pass them between players.
