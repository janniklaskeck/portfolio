This application is a GUI for the console applications livestreamer and streamlink. These applications allow the viewing or recording of supported streaming services on external video players (like the VLC player).
It provides an easier access to these applications API and provides several other functions, mostly focused around the streaming service of Twitch.tv.
I created this small application because there were no other GUI application which fit my needs at the time. It also was an opportunity for me to deepen my knowledge of the Java language(Java 7 and 8).

The application is written entirely in Java,using the JavaFX framework for all the GUI, with the exception of some css files used for styling.
Used tools were Eclipse, git and Gradle. I used a standard git branching workflow.
Together with Gradle and some plugins I can create a working executable with a single Gradle command.
