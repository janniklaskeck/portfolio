Mayhem Heroes is a Third Person Coop Shooter set in a Candy themed world.
Four players can play together via SplitScreen against the evil Candy King and his minions.

They can choose from four different Player classes, each with each unique abilities: Healer, Mage, Mechanic and Scientist.
Each of these abilities can interact with another ability, transforming them into a new, more powerful ability. The Blackhole ability of the Scientist can be combined with the chain lightning of the Mage to create an electrified blackhole which, in addition to crushing, also electrifies any enemy caught in it.

We also developed an experimental smartphone controller, allowing players to control their avatar via a smartphone connected in the local network.
