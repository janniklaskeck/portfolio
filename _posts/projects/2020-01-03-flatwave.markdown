FlatWave is a First Person Shooter where the player tries to fight through the level while being attacked by the enemy.

Includes three different weapons with two fire modes each, three different enemy types and one short level.

GENRE: First Person Shooter                                         PLATFORMS: PC

ENGINE: Unreal Engine 4                                               DURATION: 1 Months

OTHER TOOLS: Visual Studio, Blender, Gimp, Audacity, hacknPlan
This is my first "complete" First Person Shooter which I created.
Most of the assets used were created by me, with the exceptions of sound/music, some textures and the font.
I used hacknPlan to organize my work and plan possible game features.
Almost all of the programming was done in C++ with Visual Studio, except for UI related functionality or really simple features.

Below you can see some screenshots as well as a short video of a playthrough.
