Porting of current PC version to mobile.
Had access to previous port done by DotEmu(based on the old base game, before any expansions were released).
Worked on OpenGL renderer, converting new PC shaders to glsl and implementing ASTC texture support.

Added support for Google Play asset handling, dlc support and cloud saves.

Worked on dev tools to improve internal workflow, including basic build pipeline and on device debug utilities.
