Burgle Bros is originally a tabletop game developed by Tim Fowers.
This is a digital implementation very close to the original.

A group of two to four burglar specialists of the "Burgle Bros" Crew is breaking into a highly secured bank building, trying to steal all the loot while remaining undetected.
They have to use their talents, tools and wits to overcome the alarms and guards in the building.

The game is local multiplayer only, in a pass and play style.

GENRE: Digital Tabletop Game                                     PLATFORMS: PC

ENGINE: Unreal Engine 4                                               DURATION: 1.5 Months

OTHER TOOLS: Visual Studio, hacknPlan
Burgle Bros is one of my all time favorite table top games and my first game in this genre.

It is almost at feature parity with the original "base" game, missing mostly the ability to choose/randomize the game scenario.
The game is almost fully programmed in C++ with Visual Studio, only exception being most UI related functionality.
I organized the development with hacknPlan where I kept track of tasks and features.

Below you can see some ingame screenshots as well as the beginning of a playthrough (a whole playthrough can last over an hour).
